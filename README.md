<h1 align="center"> Hi I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardthomas99/">Edward</a> </h1>

<h1 id="about-me"> About Me </h1>
I am a resilient and driven full-stack developer with a deep passion for learning in all areas of life. I recently graduated from Makers Academy Bootcamp, where I gained valuable experience collaborating on multiple team projects and pair programming daily. I have the ability to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly and have a solid understanding of object-oriented languages such as Ruby and JavaScript.

Before Makers I worked in Digital Marketing, but have always had a passion for tech. Over the past year I also co-founded a collection of newsletters covering Finance, AI & Crypto, which grew to over 25,000 readers and 400,000 total impressions.

Outside of work I love studying Mandarin. I have been studying Mandarin for nearly 5 years now, and had the opportunity to improve my speaking ability first hand whilst studying in Taiwan. I still spend my weekends communicating with my Chinese teacher and learning new vocabulary.

ðŸ“– I'm a massive fan of reading both non-fiction and fiction. Two books I recently read and really enjoyed are Red Notice by Bill Browder and This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends by Nicole Perlroth. Next on my list is The Brothers Karamazov.
