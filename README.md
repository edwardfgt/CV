<h1 align="center"> Hi I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardthomas99/">Edward</a> </h1>

<h1 id="about-me"> About Me </h1>
I am a resilient and driven full-stack developer with a deep passion for learning in all areas of life. I recently graduated from Makers Academy Bootcamp, where I gained valuable experience collaborating on multiple team projects and pair programming daily. I have the ability to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly and have a solid understanding of object-oriented languages such as Ruby and JavaScript.

Before Makers I worked in Digital Marketing, but have always had a passion for tech. Over the past year I also co-founded a collection of newsletters covering Finance, AI & Crypto, which grew to over 40,000 readers and 1.5 million total impressions. 

Outside of work I love studying Mandarin. I have been studying Mandarin for nearly 5 years now, and had the opportunity to improve my speaking ability first hand whilst studying in Taiwan. I still spend my weekends communicating with my Chinese teacher and learning new vocabulary.

<h1 id="skills"> Skills </h1>

***Teamwork*** <br/>
During my time at Makers, I participated in three large group projects as well as engaging in frequent pair programming on a daily basis which taught me the value of collaborating with others to solve problems, sharing knowledge and skills, and working towards a common goal. This opportunity allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the code and its functionality, whilst also learning new approaches to problem-solving from my partner. Additionally, it enabled me to provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement, as well as receive valuable feedback from my pair programming partner.

***Organisation & Disclipline*** <br/>
I possess strong organizational skills, which I have applied in my previous role at Anuncia, where we utilized Trello for work sprints, as well as in my personal life, where I have used Toggl to track my time and Notion to manage previous projects. I am well-versed in Agile methodologies and have utilized them effectively in the past.

***Commercial Awareness*** <br/>
I have the ability to understand customer needs. My experience working with clients at Anuncia and my newsletter business has taught me the importance of putting the customer at the centre of the design process and constantly iterating to improve their experience. Whilst working on my newsletters, I had the chance to think critically about the content and layout of our emails to ensure that our subscribers had a great experience with our brand. By analyzing metrics such as open rates and click-through rates, I was able to optimize our newsletter to increase engagement and provide more value to our audience.

***Continuous Development*** <br/>
I strongly believe in the concept of growth mindsets and continuous learning. I am passionate about learning in all areas of life, and am equally comfortable exploring new technologies and expanding my knowledge of other topics, such as the economy, geo-politics, and more.

***Communication*** <br/>
As the founder of my own newsletter company, I have had numerous opportunities to hone my communication skills while networking and selling advertisement slots to a diverse range of companies in various industries, including tech, finance, beverage, and hospitality. Additionally, while studying in Taiwan, I gained invaluable experience in cross-cultural communication, as I worked with diverse teams with clashing work cultures in group projects.


<h1 id="hobbies"> Hobbies </h1>

üìñ I'm a massive fan of reading both non-fiction and fiction. Two books I recently read and really enjoyed are Red Notice by Bill Browder and Tycoons by Charles R. Morris. You can find what I'm reading on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166036548-edward-thomas).

‚òï I love Coffee, both making it myself and trying new cafes. I have a long list of my favourite cafes in London, if you would like some recommendations, let me know!

üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It seems like every software engineer likes to climb, and of course that includes me. I've been bouldering on and off over the past few years, unfortunately I got into it right as the pandemic started and therefore didn't get to climb as much as I wanted to. Now that I have moved to London there is a variety of new gyms to try and I can't wait to explore more.
